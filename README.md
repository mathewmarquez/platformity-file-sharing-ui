## Features

As the developer behind Platformity, I've designed this UI to offer a seamless experience for managing files and disks:

- **Dashboard**: Get a quick overview of your file storage and access essential navigation options.
- **Files**: Easily browse, upload, and organize your files.
- **Disks**: Monitor available disk space and manage storage efficiently.

## Technologies Used

I utilized the following technologies to bring Platformity to life:

- **HTML**: Structured the web page for clarity and accessibility.
- **CSS**: Styled the UI to be visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **JavaScript**: Implemented interactive features for enhanced user experience.

## Usage

To leverage the File Sharing Platform UI:

2. Navigate through different sections using the sidebar for easy file management.
3. Select files by clicking on them in the table view.
